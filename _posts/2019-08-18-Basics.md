title: Boring Blinking LEDs
---
### Baby's first FPGA circuit

Well, let's get started with the easiest, most boring project of all: a button that lights an LED when you press it.

```verilog
module top (input BTN1, output LED1);

assign LED1 = BTN1;

endmodule
```
Fascinating.

### Blinking LEDs

Now, let's make a circuit that will automatically blink an LED every second. The iCEBreaker board has an onboard 12MHz clock connected to pin 35 of the FPGA, so we'll use that as our clock source. We'll start by creating a register that will count clock ticks. Once the register has counted 12 million ticks, we'll toggle an LED. How many bits does out register need? Let's calculate: log(12000000)/log(2) = 23.51653..... so we'll need 24 bits.

```verilog
module top (input CLK, output LED1);

reg [23:0]counter;            

always @(posedge CLK) begin
  counter <= counter+1;
  if(counter == 12000000) begin
    counter <= 0;
    LED1 <= ~LED1;
  end
end

endmodule
```

This synthesizes and runs as you would expect, but it does produce a warning from Yosys because we're assigning a value to a wire inside an `always` block, rather than using an `assign` statement, which isn't good practice. I believe Yosys infers some internal logic to complete this assignment, but we can fix this ourselves:

```verilog
module top (input CLK, output LED1);

reg [23:0]counter;            
reg led;

always @(posedge CLK) begin
  counter <= counter+1;
  if(counter == 12000000) begin
    counter <= 0;
    led <= ~led;
  end
end

assign LED1 = led;

endmodule
```
Now, the internal 1-bit register named led holds the state we want to wire up to the LED1 pin on the FPGA board.

### Messing around with clocks

It seems kind of wasteful to use up a bunch FPGA resources on a stupid counter just because our clock signal is waay too fast for our boring LED blinker. A slower clock source would be a better fit for our application. Fortunately, the FPGA on the iCEBreaker board has its own low frequency oscillator that runs at 10kHz. We just need to invoke it and wire its output to our blinker logic:

```verilog
module top(output LED1);

wire lfclk;
reg [13:0]clkdiv;

SB_LFOSC lfosc(.CLKLFPU(1'b1), .CLKLFEN(1'b1), .CLKLF(lfclk));

always @(posedge lfclk) begin
  clkdiv <= clkdiv+1;
  if(clkdiv > 10000) begin
    clkdiv <= 0;
    LED1 <= ~LED1;
  end
end

endmodule

```

### Notes:

All of the examples posted here use the following pin constraints:

```verilog
set_io -nowarn CLK        35
set_io -nowarn LED1       26
set_io -nowarn LED2       27
set_io -nowarn LED3       25
set_io -nowarn LED4       23
set_io -nowarn LED5       21
set_io -nowarn BTN1       20
set_io -nowarn BTN2       19
set_io -nowarn BTN3       18
```
