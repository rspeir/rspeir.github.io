title: Boring Blinking LEDs
---

Well, let's get started with the easiest, most boring project of all: a button that lights an LED when you press it.

```verilog
module top (input BTN1, output LED1);

assign LED1 = BTN1;

endmodule
```

Fascinating. Now, let's make a circuit that will automatically blink an LED every second. The iCEBreaker board has an onboard 12MHz clock connected to pin 35 of the FPGA, so we'll use that as our clock source. We'll start by creating a register that will count clock ticks. Once the register has counted 12 million ticks, we'll toggle an LED. How many bits does out register need? Let's calculate: log(12000000)/log(2) = 23.51653..... so we'll need 24 bits.

```verilog
module top (input CLK, output LED1);

reg [23:0]counter;            

always @(posedge CLK) begin
  counter <= counter+1;
  if(counter == 12000000) begin
    counter <= 0;
    LED1 <= ~LED1;
  end
end

endmodule
```

NB: All of the examples posted here use the following pin constraints:

```verilog
set_io -nowarn CLK        35
set_io -nowarn LED1       26
set_io -nowarn LED2       27
set_io -nowarn LED3       25
set_io -nowarn LED4       23
set_io -nowarn LED5       21
set_io -nowarn BTN1       20
set_io -nowarn BTN2       19
set_io -nowarn BTN3       18
```
